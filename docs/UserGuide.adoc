For the comprehensive list and details of all the commands, please refer to Section 4 Features.

== Features

_The following section details the features and the command line interface commands of Ducats used to execute those features._

For each command, a format is specified for the user to key in. The following is a guide to the syntax used in expressing these formats:

* Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters to be supplied by the user. For example, in the following command: `new s/SONG_NAME s/KEY s/TIME_SIGNATURE n/TEMPO`, SONG_NAME, KEY and TIME_SIGNATURE are parameters to be provided by the user.
* The type of the parameters is indicated by a tag as follows:
** `s/` - String (i.e. a word consisting of different characters)
** `n/` - Number (Integer)
* When representing Notes, the DURATION_PITCH format is observed:
** The pitches available are: UC, UB, UA, UG, UF, UE, UD, MC, LB, LA, LG, LF, LE, LD, LC
** The durations available are: 1, 2*, 2, 4*, 4, 8. _(Just as in sheet music, a single dot (*) lengthens the duration of a note by 50%. Modification with double dots coming in v2.0.)_
** More information regarding pitches and durations is given in Section 5 Introduction to Basic Music Theory

An autocorrect has been implemented to help in the use of the application. It will try to correct the typos in the commands and suggest the command that the user meant. For instance 'helo' will be interpreted as 'help'



=== Viewing help: `help`

HelpCommand can list either all the commands and their formats in a list, or a certain command and its format.
This command is to remind users of the input format of a certain command, or to show users all the commands.

* _Format_: `help`
** List all commands and their respective formats in a list.

* _Format_: `help s/COMMAND_NAME`
** List the format for a certain command.
** _Example_: `help list`
*** List format of input for `list` command.

=== Viewing your list of songs: `list`

In the case of there being multiple songs, the list command ensures that navigation is not hampered by displaying the full list of songs you have created in the past. This data is stored in a specific data file outside the application. This file can also be directly edited to change the data to be loaded into Ducats, making exporting and importing data a breeze.

_Format_: `list`

=== Creating your new song: `new`

Creates a new song of the C major key, 4/4 time signature and tempo as specified by the user. [Support of songs in different keys, time signatures and tempo coming in v2.0]

_Format_:
`new s/SONG_NAME s/KEY s/TIME_SIGNATURE n/TEMPO`

_Examples_:

* `new Twinkle_Twinkle c 4/4 120`
creates a song titled “Twinkle_Twinkle”, in the default key of C Major, with time signature of 4/4 and tempo of 120 beats per minute (bpm).

* `new Vicarious c 4/4 80`
creates a song titled “Vicarious”, in the key of C Major, with time signature of 4/4 and a tempo of 80 bpm.

=== Deleting your existing song: `delete`

Feeling like you are going nowhere with a certain composition? This command is used to delete a song from your Ducat’s song list. You can delete the song by specifying either its number or name.

_Format_: `delete n/SONG_NUM` OR `delete s/SONG_NAME`

_Examples_:

* `delete Vicarious`
deletes the existing song titled “Vicarious”.

* `delete 1`
deletes the existing song at the first position of the song list.


=== Opening a song for editing: `open`

This command is for you to navigate to and select the song you intend to edit. When the specified song is opened, your other songs cannot be edited. This ensures that your existing music composition data is protected and isolated from the modifications you make to the song that is opened.

_Format_: `open s/SONG_NAME`

_Example_:

* `open Twinkle_Twinkle`
opens and selects the existing song titled “Twinkle_Twinkle”. It is now ready for your editing.


=== Viewing Command Line representation of song: `view`

For a quick view that is easily readable regardless of musical background, the `view` command displays the last bar of the song you specified.

_Format_: `view s/SONG_NAME`

_Example_:

* `view Twinkle_Twinkle`
displays the visual representation of the last bar of the existing song titled “Twinkle_Twinkle”.


=== Adding new bars to your song: `addbar`

The addition of notes into your song is done with the `addbar` command. This command adds a new whole bar to end of your opened song. This new bar consists of notes as specified by you. The total duration of your desired notes must adds up to one beat. (E.g. 1 whole note, 2 half notes or 4 quarter notes etc.)

_Format_: `addbar s/NOTES`

_Examples_:

* `addbar 1_UA`
adds a bar consisting of 1 whole note of pitch UPPER_A to the end of your opened song.

* `addbar 2_MC 2_LC`
adds a bar consisting of 2 half notes of pitch MIDDLE_C and LOWER_C to the end of your opened song.

* `addbar 4_UA 8_UC 8_UD 4_LB 4_UD`
adds a bar consisting of 1 quarter note of pitch UPPER_A, 2 eighth notes of pitches UPPER_C and UPPER_D, 1 quarter note of pitch LOWER_B and 1 quarter note of pitch UPPER_D.


=== Deleting a bar in your song: `deletebar`

Want to erase your mistakes when composing? The `delete` command is used to delete a bar from your song. The bar of the number specified will be deleted from the current song that is open.

_Format_: `deletebar n/BAR_NUM`

_Example_:

* `deletebar 1`
deletes the first bar of your opened song.


=== Inserting a new bar between existing bars in your song: `insertbar`

This command is for you to create and insert a new whole bar between existing bars in your opened song. The position where the new bar will be inserted is specified by you. The total duration of your desired notes in your new bar must adds up to one beat.

_Format_: `insertbar n/BAR_NUM s/NOTES`

_Example_:

* `insertbar 2 1_UA`
creates and inserts your new bar consisting of a whole note of pitch UPPER_A between the existing first bar and second bar of the song.


=== Editing a bar in your song: `editbar`

The editing of an existing bar in your song is done with the `editbar` command. The bar to be edited is specified by you through its bar number. The new bar consists of notes specified by you and its total duration adds up to one beat.

_Format_: `editbar n/BAR_NUM s/NOTES`

_Example_:

* `editbar 1 2_UB 2_UB`
edits the first bar of your opened song into a new bar consisting of 2 half notes, both of pitch UPPER_B.


=== Swapping two existing bars in your song: `swapbar`

Want an easy way to swap two existing bars in your song? The `swapbar` command does that for you. The bars to be swapped is specified by you through its bar number.

_Format_: `swapbar n/BAR_NUM n/BAR_NUM`

_Example_:

* `swapbar 1 3`
swaps the existing first and third bar of your opened song.


=== Grouping bars together: `group`

In music, repetition of tunes and rhythms are very common. The group command allows users to efficiently save tunes and rhythms for each of their songs. The user can group a continuous range of bars between two indices (inclusive) in the song track and give a name to this group. However, this group will be saved only under that song and will not be accessible from other songs. Grouping is very useful as this allows the user to easily insert groups into their song tracks instead of manually adding the same bars again.

_Format_:
`group n/START_NUM n/END_NUM s/GROUP_NAME`

_Example_: `group 2 4 sunlight`

The above command groups the bars from index 2 to index 4 (inclusive) and gives it the name “sunlight”.

=== Copying sections of music: `copy`
This command allows you to copy a bar, a series of bars or a group and paste it into any part of the song. This command is also designed to be flexible as it supports 4 different input formats

==== Copy a group to the end of the current song track: `copy GROUP_NAME `
This command allows you to copy a group to the end of the current track. Note that groups are unique to each song and cannot be accessed from a different song. 

Format: `copy GROUP_NAME`

Example: `copy jingle`

The above command will copy the group named jingle to the end of the current song track:

==== Copy range of bars to end of current song track: `copy START_NUM END_NUM`
This command allows you to copy a range of continuous bars (inclusive) to the end of the current track. Note that in particular, to copy just one bar to the end of the track, simply put the same numbers for starting and ending index.

Format: `copy START_INDEX END_INDEX`

Example: `copy 1 2`

The above command will copy the bars from 1 to 2 (both inclusive) to the end of the current song track.

==== Copy a group into a particular index: `copy GROUP_NAME PASTE_INDEX`
This command will copy a group and paste it into a specified index. All bars starting from that index will be pushed forward to make space for this group. Note that paste index cannot exceed the last index of the current track.

Format: `copy GROUP_NAME PASTE_INDEX`

Example: `copy jingle 5`

The above command will insert the group named “jingle” into the 5th index of the current song track.

==== Copy range of bars into a particular index:  `copy START_INDEX END_INDEX PASTE_INDEX`
This command allows you to copy a continuous series of bars from the starting index to the ending index specified and paste it into the specified PASTE_INDEX. Note that you cannot paste index cannot exceed the last index of the current track. All the bars starting from the bar at the PASTE_INDEX will be pushed forward to make space for the copied bars.

Format: `copy START_NUM END_NUM PASTE_INDEX`

Example: `copy 1 2 5`

The above command will copy the bars from index 1 to 2 (both inclusive) and insert that into the 5th index of the current song track.


=== Combining sections of music:
For any musician, having the freedom to overlay a part of one song to another (overlaps two components and we play the 2 components together at the same time)  will save them a lot of time and also make it easier for them to create a composition. The overlay function aims to perform this functionality and allows the freedom to overlay a bar-bar, bar-group, group - group. 

==== Combining bar-bar: `overlay`

This command allows the user to overlay a bar from the same song to another bar on the same song, i.e. opened song. To change the song please use the `open` command

_Format_:
`overlay <bar_num to be overlayed> <bar_num to be overlayed to>`

_Example_: `overlay 1 2`


The above command overlays bar 1 onto bar 2 (see Figure 3.4 for example demo). 

image::overlay_1_2.png[]
Figure 3.4: overlaying of bar 1 onto bar 2.


The repeat parameter can be added to the end to overlay the bar from the required start point till the end. 

_Format_:
`overlay <bar_num to be overlayed> <bar_num to be overlayed to> repeat`

_Example_: `overlay 1 3 repeat`


The above command overlays bar 1 onto bar 3 and onwards. 

The output will be an ascii printed version of the song after overlaying. 


==== Combining group-group: `overlay_group_group`
Allows the users to overlay a group from one song to another. The interesting aspect of this feature is that it allows the users to overlay groups of unequal length, i.e. a group with a larger number of bars onto a group with a smaller number of bars and vice versa. The following example shows what will happen when combining two unequal groups:  


* Group 1: {Bar X Bar Y} 
* Group 2 : {Bar A Bar B Bar C Bar D}
* Overlaying Group 1 onto Group 2:  { [Bar A + Bar X] [Bar B + Bar Y] [Bar C + Bar X] [Bar D + Bar Y]}   
* Overlaying Group 2 onto Group 1: { [Bar A + Bar X] [Bar B + Bar Y]} 

_Format_:

`overlay_group_group <song_name to be overlayed from> <group_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <group_number>`

_Example_: `overlay_group_group twinkle 1 jingle 3`

 
The above command overlays group 1 from twinkle onto group 4 of jingle 

_Example_: `overlay_group_group twinkle 1 twinkle 2`

If group 1 from twinkle is overlayed onto group 2 of twinkle, where group 1 contains bar 1 to 2 and group 2 consists of bar 3 to 5. See Figure 3.5 for example) 

image::example_song_annotation.png[]
Figure 3.5: Example song 


The output of the above command ( `overlay_group_group twinkle 1 twinkle 2` ) must be (Figure 3.6): 

image::overlay_group_group_1_2.png[]
Figure 3.6: `overlay_group_group twinkle 1 twinkle 2` 


If we try to run `overlay_group_group twinkle 2 twinkle 1` (Figure 3.7) 

The output will be: 

image::overlay_group_group_2_1.png[]
Figure 3.7: `overlay_group_group twinkle 2 twinkle 1`

The repeat parameter can be added to the end to overlay the group from the required start point till the end. 

_Format_:
`overlay_group_group <song_name to be overlayed from> <group_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <group_number> repeat`

_Example_: `overlay_group_group twinkle 1 jingle 3 repeat`


The above command overlays group 1 onto jingle's group 4 and onwards. 


If the indexes does not exist then an exception is thrown. 


==== Combining bar-group: `overlay_bar_group`

Allows the users to overlay a  bar onto a group from the same song, i.e. opened song. To change the song please use the `open` command. It works in the similar way as the `overlay` commands. The repeat parameter allows the user to overlay through all the groups from the specified starting group. 


_Format_:

`overlay_bar_group <bar_number to be overlayed> <group_number to be overlayed to>`

_Example_: `overlay_bar_group 1 2`


The above command overlays bar 1 from the opened song onto group 2. 

If the group 2 was from bar 3 to 5 on the following song (Figure 3.8): 
image::example_song_annotation.png[]
Figure 3.8: Example song 

The expected output will be (Figure 3.9): 

image::overlay_bar_group_1_2.png[]
Figure 3.9: `overlay_bar_group 1 2`

The repeat parameter can be added to the end to overlay the bar from the required start point till the last group. 

_Format_:
`overlay_bar_group <bar_number to be overlayed> <group_number to be overlayed to> repeat`

_Example_: `overlay_bar_group 1 3 repeat`


The above command will allow the user to overlay bar 1 to group 3 and onwards till the end of group lists. 

The output will be an ascii printed version of the song after overlaying. 


==== Combining bars across songs: `overlay_bar_song`


This command allows the user to overlay a bar from one song to another song's bar. 

_Format_:
`overlay_bar_song <song_name to be overlayed from> <bar_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <bar_number>`


_Example_: `overlay_bar_song twinkle 3 jingle 4`


The above command overlays bar 3 from twinkle onto bar 4 of jingle 

The repeat parameter can be added to the end to overlay the bar from the required start point till the end. 

_Format_:
`overlay_bar_song <song_name to be overlayed from> <bar_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <bar_number> repeat`

_Example_: `overlay_bar_song twinkle 3 jingle 4 repeat`


The above command overlays bar 3 onto jingle's bar 4 and onwards. 

The output will be an ascii printed version of the song after overlaying.


=== Viewing your list of groups in a song: `list_group`
Gets the list of groups in the current or opened song so that you can refer to it later when calling it.
Format:
list_group

Additionally you can add the starting characters of the group that you want to find as a parameter.
Format:
list_group -starting_substring

Example: list_group twi
In the above example, if there exists two groups named “twilight” and “twinkle”, both of them will be displayed and the groups that do not start with “twi” will not be displayed.


=== Displaying song in ASCII format: `ascii song`
This command lets you view the song you are creating as a songsheet in ASCII format. Different symbols are used to represent music notes, rest note and different durations. The song sheet comprises of 15 rows. At the start of each row, the pitch is indicated. The bars in the song sheet are separated with by “|”. The design of this ascii song sheet is very similar to the actual musical song sheet, except, symbols are used to represent the different notes.

==== Displaying song in ASCII format: `ascii song SONG_NAME`
To display a song as ascii song sheet, simply use the following command

Format: `ascii song SONG_NAME`

Example: `ascii song twinkle`

The above command lets you view the song sheet for the song twinkle.

==== Displaying group in ASCII format: `ascii group GROUP_NAME`
To display a group in the song in the ascii song sheet format, simply use the following command

Format: `ascii group GROUP_NAME`

Example: `ascii group twilight`

The above command lets you view the song sheet for the group twilight.

==== Displaying bar in ASCII format: `ascii bar BAR_INDEX`
To display a bar in the song in the ascii song sheet format, simply use the following command

Format: `ascii bar BAR_INDEX`

Example: `ascii bar 1`

The following command lets you view the song sheet for the group twilight.

This command lets you view the song you are creating as a song sheet in ASCII format. Here’s an example of how it looks like:

=== Undoing your previous action: `undo`

UndoCommand can redo the most recent commands that changes the data of the song list until reaching the very first command since starting.
Currently UndoCommand only works for adding songs and deleting songs, which are `new` and `delete`.

The next version of `undo` will be released in v2.0, when the undo can be applied for all the commands except
for commands that do not change the song list.

_Format_:
`undo`

=== Redoing your previous action: `redo`

RedoCommand can redo the most recent commands that have been undone until there is no more commands that can be redone.
Currently RedoCommand only works for adding songs and deleting songs, which are `new` and `delete`.

The next version of `redo` will be released in v2.0, when the redo can be applied for all the commands except
for commands that do not change the song list.

_Format_:
`redo`

=== Starting a metronome: `metronome`

Rhythm is an essential part of musical composition, and it is useful to have a visual or aural cue regarding the different types of rhythm possible, especially for amateurs. To facilitate this, a metronome feature is included, where the user can cause a metronome to appear on the screen on the screen for a specific number of bars.

_Format_:
`metronome n/DURATION_IN_BARS n/TEMPO s/TIME_SIGNATURE`

_Example_:
`metronome 10 120 4/4` will start a metronome for 10 bars, each consisting of four notes, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute.

The metronome can be started from anywhere, and the only step is to type in the command according to the format provided above. Upon pressing 'Enter', the metronome will appear on the screen. The numbers 1 through 4 will appear in sequence for 10 times, with each change in number happening every half-second. The number 1 will be accompanied by a hash ('#') for emphasis, as the first beat of every bar is considered more significant in music.

image::ducats_metronome2.png[]

Upon execution, the user interface will output 'Done!', and you are free to key in your next command.

image::ducats_metronome3.png[]


=== Exiting Ducats: `bye`

Want to take a break or finish composing for the day? This command exits and closes Ducats. The closing message will be displayed and then Ducats will be closed. After this, you will be returned to your original Terminal command line.

_Format_: `bye`

[NOTE]
When coming back to Ducats, your songs will be sorted in alphabetical order when you view the list so that you can easily find the creation you intend to work on.


=== Saving the data

All of the song data is saved to the hard disk automatically after any modifications have been made through a command. There is no need to save manually. To access the data in order to export or import songs, simply access the `data` folder in the directory that contains the program file. By putting in `.txt` files of the same data format, the data will be imported seamlessly the next time you start up Ducats. Additionally, you can also edit the data directly on the `.txt` file if you need to make minor changes to the data without booting up Ducats.

[NOTE]
Direct data manipulation is only recommended for more advanced users. Ducats will be unable to read your song data if it detects an invalid format.

The data found in the `.txt` file is structured as follows:

    NAME KEY TEMPO
    BAR_1
    BAR_2
    ...
    BAR_N
    groups:
    GROUP_1_NAME BAR_1 ... BAR_N
    ...
    GROUP_N_NAME BAR_1 ... BAR_N

Each bar, represented above by `BAR_1`, `BAR_2` and so on, is formatted as follows, with the segments representing each individual bar, chord and note being labelled with B, C and N respectively:

    [[UAs;UCs],[UA;UC],[UA;UC],[UA;UC],[MCs;LDs],[MC;LD],[MC;UDs],[MC,UD]]
    |----------------------------------B---------------------------------|
     |---C---|
      |N|

[NOTE]
The above bar is populated with different chords and notes for the purposes of demonstration.

Since the default time signature of a Song you create is in 4 4, each Bar consists of eight Chords.The “s”, if present, signifies that that Note that has the duration of a 1/8 note is the start of a bigger Note object or one of the same duration. For example, in the above visualization, the Bar consists of an Upper A Note with the duration of 1/2 and an Upper C Note with the same duration in the first four chords.

=== Auto-suggesting commands

An auto-complete has been implemented to help in the use of the application. It will try to correct the typos in the commands and suggest the command that the user meant. For instance 'helo' will be interpreted as 'help'

=== Playing music: `play` [coming in v2.0]

Plays the music specified, or the whole song if not specified. When a song is not opened, will play the song specified.

_Format_:
`play n/STARTING_BAR_NO n/ENDING_BAR_NO` OR
`play s/SONG_NAME`  (when no song has been opened)

== Introduction to Basic Music Theory

Since Ducats is aimed towards music amateurs who may not know much about music theory or composition, the app is designed with simplicity and ease of understanding in mind. However, a very basic understanding of music theory is needed to effectively use the app.

=== Musical components

*NOTE, PITCH AND DURATION*

Fundamentally, the most basic unit of music is a note, which consists of both a pitch as well as a duration. In Ducats, a note can have 15 distinct pitches spanning across two octaves:

LOWER_C, LOWER_D, LOWER_E, LOWER_F, LOWER_G, LOWER_A, LOWER_B, MIDDLE_C, UPPER_D, UPPER_E, UPPER_F, UPPER_G, UPPER_A, UPPER_B, UPPER_C

The pitches in the upper octave have twice the frequency of the corresponding pitches in the lower octave. For example, a note with pitch of UPPER_F has twice the frequency of a note with pitch of LOWER_F. Other than the aforementioned pitches, in order to facilitate breaks and pauses, there is also the option for a REST, which is a special type of note which signifies silence. In Ducats command syntax, the pitch is represented by the last two letters of the note. For example, 1_MC represents a note of pitch MIDDLE_C with a relative duration of 1

In music, duration is referred to in relative terms. Each note has a duration that is relative to that of a “whole” note, which corresponds to a fixed duration of time. Generally, the durations are in powers of half, with the exception of dotted notes, which lengthen the duration of an non-dotted note by half. The available durations of notes in Ducats are shown as follows:

[cols=3*]
|===
| *Name*
| *Relative Duration*
| *Example Syntax in Ducats*

| Whole Note
| 1
| `1_MC`

| Dotted Half Note
| 3/4
| `2*_MC`

| Half Note
| 1/2
| `2_MC`

| Dotted Quarter Note
| 3/8
| `4*_MC`

| Quarter Note
| 1/4
| `4_MC`

| Eighth Note
| 1/8
| `8_MC`
|===

For purposes of simplicity, the documentation refers to the durations by the American convention, as compared to the less intuitive British convention, where notes have special names, such as crochet, quaver, semibreve and so on.

*CHORDS AND BARS*

When multiple notes are being played together, then a chord is formed. An example would be when a pianist presses multiple keys on the keyboard at once, or a guitarist strums the guitar while fingering different sections of the strings.

A Bar is the collection of multiple chords. In Ducats, the duration of a bar is standardized on each song based on the time signature provided at the time of creation (to be explained in 5.2). Since the rhythm of the song does not follow normal interpretations of time, the number of the bar in the song serves as an easy method of navigating to specific points in the song.

=== Attributes of a song

Music can be thought of as the accumulation of different patterns of rhythm and pitch. Formally, each song has three main attributes, which are implemented in Ducats, namely key, tempo and time signature. The latter two are to do with the rhythm of the song, while the key relates to the pitch of the song.

[NOTE]
In order to create a new song, all three of these attributes need to be specified, although they do not presently affect the modification of the songs and the execution of the features in v1.4. This is to ensure that, upon upgrade to v2.0, you will not lose all your composition data.

*KEY*

A key consists of a group of pitches that sounds pleasant and consistent when put together. There are minor and major keys, with major keys usually sounding happier and minor keys sounding sadder.

For Ducats, the default key for all songs is C Major, with the ability to change the Notes added based on the key coming in v2.0.

*TEMPO*

In most basic terms, tempo refers to the speed at which the song progresses. In the case of Ducats, tempo is measured in beats per minute, where one beat consists of one rhythmic unit of time as specified in the time signature.

If you are unsure of the appropriate tempo for your song, you can start the integrated visual metronome, as described in Section 4.19. In v2.0, with the Play functionality, you will be able to hear your composed music at the specified tempo.

*TIME SIGNATURE*

The time signature of a song consists of two numbers that signify how many how many beats are in a bar and what note duration does each beat correspond to respectively. For example, a song with a time signature of 4 4 has 4 beats in each bar, with each beat corresponding to the duration of a quarter note. Hence, a bar in a 4 4 song can have any combination of notes whose duration is equivalent to 1 whole note, such as four quarter notes, eight eighth notes, or a dotted half note and a quarter note.

4 4 is the most common time signature for modern popular music. Considering this, the default time signature for songs composed in Ducats is 4 4, with the functionality to support other time signatures coming in v2.0.
